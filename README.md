# guiTkinterCV2Frame
Finally got an OOP version of tkinter running open CV video in a custom frame

I am following Adrian's totorials on PyImageSearch (HIGHLY RECCOMENDED).  He provides excellent 
tools to accomplish real things in OpenCV, but each of them is stand-alone.

My thought is these tools MUST be able to be used modular way, so working that direction.  

This application has 4 pages, one of which has a working frame with live video from CV2.  Feel 
free to use any part, and also to point out any improvements you may be willing to offer.
